# DLMDSEDE02
### Project Data Engineering

### Build a real-time data backend for a data-intensive application

## Conception Phase

The project simulates the real-time live tracking of aircraft positioning via ADS-B data, similar to that of the Flightradar24.com website. Flightradar24.com tracks approximately 200,000 flights per day with over 40,000 receivers. Roughly 7,000 to 8,000 commercial flights are airborne at any given time. Each aircraft transmits its position every second.

In the absence of a real ADS-B dataset, a fictitious dataset is generated by a Python script with a .CSV output. It then feeds in micro-batches of 7,000 rows with a time delay to simulate real-time data streaming. 

## Development Phase 

The data is processed by Apache Kafka and stored in a Postgres database. The database is queried by a data-server container which feeds a web-based app to visually track the aircraft on the map. All components are run as Docker containers, making the project reproducible:

1.	Data-generator
2.	Postgres DB
3.	Zookeeper 
4.	Kafka
5.	Kafka-producer
6.	Kafka-consumer
7.	WebSocket server
8.	Data-server
9.	Frontend app

Each container can be easily managed and developed independently, thereby facilitating the CI/CD pipeline.

The whole architecture can be scaled up by adding more Kafka producer and consumer containers and grouping them. 

Audit logs will be implemented throughout the project to enable performance monitoring. 

Security and access control can be managed via Kafka's built-in security features like ACLs (Access Control Lists). Access to the Postgres DB can be set up based on the user role. Firewall rules can be used for network security. 

Data Governance can be set up with the help of Kafka retention policies and Postgres DB data retention policies.
